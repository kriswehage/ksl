overview
--------

*KSL* is a sparse math library written in the C programming language that is targeted to real-time kinematics, dynamics, contact detection, robotics and 3D visualization applications.

*KSL* contains a number of utility functions to transform vectors, screws, coscrews and spatial inertia matrices using the minimum number of operations as described in the *KSL* documentation at https://ksl.shift-dynamics.io.

Additionally, *KSL* contains routines for performing LU decomposition with complete row and column pivoting, an important component in the robust processing of kinematics and dynamics equations.

The code is available open-source with minimal restrictions. If you find the code to be useful in your projects, we would love to hear from you.
